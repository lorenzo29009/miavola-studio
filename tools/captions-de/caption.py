LAYOUT (hard — CapCut renders captions at large font; lines wider than ~24 chars wrap awkwardly):
A. Group words into NATURAL caption units (a short clause / breath group, ~4–7 words). Render a unit on 1 line if it fits ~22 chars, else on 2 lines (literal "\\n"). Aim for a natural mix of 1- and 2-line captions — don't force one line, don't pad short units into two, and avoid 1–2 word fragments.
B. Each visible line: AT MOST ~24 characters (including spaces). Wide letters (m, w) take more room than narrow ones (i, l, t); keep wide-letter lines shorter.
C. Each caption: AT MOST ~48 characters total visible text.
D. NEVER break a word in the middle. Words stay intact.
E. A long single word (>24 chars) goes alone in its own caption.

INSEPARABLE SEMANTIC UNITS (these phrases MUST NEVER be split across a caption boundary OR across a "\\n" inside a caption — both apply equally):
F. Article / possessive / demonstrative + noun: e.g., {meta['art_examples']}. Never end a caption with an article, possessive or demonstrative.
G. Preposition + its noun phrase: e.g., {meta['prep_examples']}. Never end a caption with a preposition.
H. Adjective + noun, adverb + adjective/verb.
I. Auxiliary + participle: e.g., {meta['aux_examples']}.
J. Modal + infinitive: e.g., {meta['modal_examples']}.
K. Negation + element it negates: e.g., {meta['neg_examples']}.
L. Idiomatic units, product names and English borrowings: e.g., {meta['idiom_examples']}.

CAPTION BOUNDARY RULES:
M. A caption MUST end at a natural prosodic/clause boundary: end of sentence, end of clause, after a comma that opens a new clause, or before a coordinating conjunction ({meta['conjunctions']}) when the caption already has ≥3 words.
N. Lists are MANDATORY one-item-per-caption. Example: {meta['list_example']} → each item its own caption. Never combine list items.
O. GROUP INTO NATURAL UNITS (~4–7 words): a caption is a breath group / short clause, not a 1–2 word fragment. Combine adjacent words and inseparable units until a natural pause (clause/sentence boundary). Render on 1 line if short, 2 lines if longer — a natural mix is expected, neither forced to one line nor padded to two.
O2. NEVER leave a single short word (e.g. "to", "and", "is", "so", a 1–4 letter word) alone as its own caption. Attach it to the adjacent caption it belongs with. EXCEPTIONS that DO stand alone: a word the speaker repeats for emphasis, and each item of a list.

TEXT RULES:
P. Fix obvious Whisper transcription errors. Never add or skip words.
Q. {meta['capitalization']}
R. Remove periods, commas, semicolons, colons, exclamation marks. KEEP question marks, percent signs (%), slashes (/), ampersands (&), quotation marks{meta['punctuation_extra']}.

STRICT — you may ONLY merge consecutive draft captions, or keep a caption as-is. You CANNOT split, reorder, add, remove or change ANY word; you only choose where caption boundaries fall.

Make each final caption a natural unit:
- A short clause / breath group, usually 4–7 words, that reads well as 1 OR 2 on-screen lines (roughly ≤ 45 characters total). Do NOT merge so much that a caption would need more than two lines.
- End each caption at a natural pause (clause end, sentence end, or just before a new clause). Do not end a caption on a conjunction, preposition or article — group it with what follows.
- ALWAYS merge a boundary that splits a tight pair: a number from its unit/noun, an article/possessive/preposition from its noun, or an auxiliary/modal from its verb.
- Never leave a single short word as its own caption — merge it with its phrase.
- KEEP SEPARATE (do not merge): a word repeated for emphasis (it must stand alone), and each item of a list (one per caption).

    prompt = f"""You are a TikTok-style German caption editor. Split the transcription below into short, well-paced captions for a vertical video.

Hard constraints (CapCut renders captions at large font on vertical 9:16 video; lines wider than ~24 chars wrap awkwardly):

LAYOUT:
A. Group words into NATURAL caption units — a short complete clause or breath group, usually 4–7 words. Render a unit on 1 line when it fits one line (~22 chars), and on 2 lines (literal "\\n") when the unit is longer. Aim for a NATURAL MIX of 1- and 2-line captions: do NOT force everything onto one line, and do NOT pad a genuinely short unit into two. Avoid 1–2 word fragments — they read as choppy.
B. Each visible line: AT MOST ~24 characters (including spaces). German has many narrow letters (i, l, t, r, f, ä) that take little room, so a line of 24 narrow chars is fine; lines full of wide letters (m, w) should be a little shorter.
C. Therefore each caption: AT MOST ~48 characters total visible text. Going under is fine; going over is not.
D. NEVER break a word in the middle of letters. Words that are NOT German compound nouns stay intact ("Entscheidung", "Erfahrung", "Computer", "Nachbarin" — never split).
E. A German compound word > 24 chars (e.g., "Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung", "Versicherungsgesellschaft", "Lebensmittelgeschäft", "100-Meter-Staffellauf") goes alone in its own caption and is broken at a meaningful compound boundary, hyphen at end of line 1: "Geschwindigkeits-\\nbegrenzung", "Versicherungs-\\ngesellschaft". This mid-word two-line split of a long compound is REQUIRED and must be kept. A hyphen may appear ONLY at the end of line 1 of such a real two-line split. If a compound fits on ONE line (≤ ~24 chars, e.g. "Wassereinlagerungen"), write it WHOLE with NO hyphen — never insert a hyphen into a word that stays on one line.

INSEPARABLE SEMANTIC UNITS (these phrases MUST NEVER be split across a caption boundary OR across a "\\n" line break inside a caption — both apply EQUALLY):
The "\\n" line break within a caption is just as much a "split" as starting a new caption. ALL inseparable-unit rules below apply to BOTH.
Example check: "es liegt an diesem Problem" (26 chars).
  ❌ Wrong: "es liegt an diesem\\nProblem" — splits "diesem Problem" (demonstrative + noun).
  ✅ Right: "es liegt an\\ndiesem Problem" — line break between clauses, semantic unit intact.
Always ask: would breaking here separate two words that belong together grammatically? If yes, find another break point (a different word boundary within the caption, or split into 2 separate captions).
F. Adverb + adjective/participle: "sehr glücklich", "extrem müde", "ziemlich groß", "wirklich schön", "ganz schön".
G. Adverb + verb form: "dachte immer", "habe nie", "geht gut", "ist auch".
H. Auxiliary + participle: "habe gemacht", "ist gegangen", "wird gebaut", "wurde gefunden".
I. Modal + infinitive: "kann gehen", "muss arbeiten", "sollte helfen", "möchte schlafen".
J. Negation + element it negates: "nie wieder", "nicht gut", "kein Geld", "niemals".
K. Separable verb particle + verb root: "rufe an", "fängt an", "steht auf", "hört zu", "macht mit". The particle stays in the same caption as the verb stem even if they appear in different positions in the sentence.
L. Preposition + its noun phrase (article+adj+noun): "mit dem Auto", "in der Stadt", "bei der Arbeit", "an Weihnachten", "für meine Familie". Never end a caption with a preposition. Never split between preposition and its object.
M. Article/possessive/demonstrative + noun: "der Mann", "eine Idee", "meine Tasche", "diese Sache", "das große Haus". Never end a caption with an article/possessive/demonstrative.
N. Comparative/quantifier + noun: "mehr Geld", "weniger Zeit", "viel Wasser", "20% Rabatt", "zwei Stunden".
O. Tight idiomatic units, product names and English borrowings stay as ONE token: "Social Media", "Fun Fact", "Best Friend", "Work-Life-Balance", brand names.

CAPTION BOUNDARY RULES:
P. A caption MUST end at a natural prosodic/clause boundary: end of sentence, end of clause (after subordinator's verb), after a comma that introduces a new clause, before a coordinating conjunction (und/aber/oder/denn) that starts a new clause.
Q. Lists (items separated by commas, e.g., "Brot, Milch, Eier") → each item its own caption.
R. If forced to choose between a 2-line caption with an unnatural break (e.g., splitting "extrem | müde") and TWO 1-line captions (one with "und das Wetter war", one with "extrem kalt"), CHOOSE THE TWO 1-LINE CAPTIONS.
S. **GROUP INTO NATURAL UNITS (≈4–7 words).** A caption is a natural breath group / short clause — NOT a 1–2 word fragment. Combine adjacent words and inseparable units until you reach a natural pause (clause end, sentence end, or right before a new clause). Render the unit on 1 line if it is short (~22 chars) or on 2 lines (\\n) if it is longer — a natural mix of 1- and 2-line captions is expected, neither forced to one line nor padded to two. NEVER leave a single short word ("tun", "und", "ist", "doch", any 1–4 letter word) alone as its own caption — attach it to the caption it grammatically belongs with. EXCEPTIONS that DO stand alone: a word the speaker repeats for emphasis (e.g. "Nie … Nie", "Endlich … Endlich"), and each item of a list.
   The "inseparable unit" rule means UNITS DON'T SPLIT INTERNALLY — it does NOT mean every unit must be its own caption. Multiple units CAN be combined in one caption.
   Example: "und trotzdem kommst du morgens" (5 words, 30 chars) → ONE caption: "und trotzdem\\nkommst du morgens" (line 1: 12c, line 2: 17c). NOT two captions.
   Example: "immer müder und müder" (4 words) → ONE caption: "immer müder\\nund müder". NOT two captions of one unit each.
   Example: "du fährst seit Jahren jeden Tag zur Arbeit" (8 words) — too long, split into 2 captions at a clause pause, e.g. "du fährst seit Jahren" + "jeden Tag zur Arbeit".
   Rule of thumb: build a natural breath group (~4–7 words) up to a clause/sentence pause, then start a new caption. Short unit → 1 line; longer unit → 2 lines.

TEXT RULES:
T. Fix obvious Whisper transcription errors (only clear ones): wrong word boundaries ("im Stande" → "imstande"), obvious homophones that make no sense in context, and misheard number words (a stray word where a number was clearly spoken). Write spoken cardinal numbers as DIGITS ("sechs Kilo" → "6 Kilo", "achtzig Euro" → "80 Euro").
U. Never add or skip words. EXCEPTION: when the speaker repeats a word for emphasis (e.g. "Nie … Nie"), KEEP the repeated word and give it its OWN caption — do not drop it and do not merge it into the neighbouring caption.
V. Capitalization = write each word EXACTLY as it appears in the MIDDLE of a sentence. Capitalize ONLY words that are inherently capitalized in German: nouns, proper names, and the formal-address words Sie/Ihr/Ihre/Ihren/Ihrem/Ihrer/Ihres/Ihnen. Do NOT capitalize a word just because it starts the caption — lexical verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, articles, conjunctions and prepositions stay lowercase at caption start (e.g. "trinkst du genug", "gesund bleiben", "wichtig ist", "und dann").
W. Remove periods, commas, semicolons, colons, exclamation marks. KEEP question marks, percent signs (%), slashes (/), ampersands (&), quotation marks.

Editorial rules:
1. Lists are MANDATORY one-item-per-caption. If words are read out as a list (any enumeration, e.g. "Brot, Milch, Eier"), EACH item becomes its OWN caption — even single-word items. Never combine list items.
2. Split before subordinating/coordinating conjunctions ("und", "aber", "oder", "weil", "dass", "denn", "doch", "sondern", "wenn", "als", "ob", "obwohl") when the caption already has ≥3 words.
3. Split after commas, periods, question marks.
4. Keep meaningful units together as ONE token: product/brand names and English borrowings ("Social Media", "Fun Fact", "Best Friend").
5. Never add or skip words. Only correct spelling/word-boundary errors as above. EXCEPTION: an emphatic repetition is kept and gets its own caption.
6. Capitalization = write each word EXACTLY as it appears in the MIDDLE of a sentence. Capitalize ONLY inherently-capitalized words: nouns, proper names, and formal address Sie/Ihr/Ihre/Ihren/Ihrem/Ihrer/Ihres/Ihnen. Do NOT capitalize a word just because it starts the caption — lexical verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, articles, conjunctions and prepositions stay lowercase at caption start.
7. Remove periods, commas, semicolons, colons, exclamation marks. KEEP question marks, percent signs (%), slashes (/), ampersands (&), quotation marks.

Examples of good captions (1 or 2 lines, each line ≤ ~24 chars, semantic units intact):
- "ich war gestern\\nim Supermarkt"          ← 2 lines, ok
- "Fun Fact"                                  ← 1 line, borrowing
- "mit dem Auto"                              ← 1 line, prep+noun
- "extrem müde"                               ← 1 line, adv+adj must stay together
- "und das Wetter war"                        ← 1 line, complete clause start
- "Geschwindigkeits-\\nbegrenzung"            ← long compound alone, split at boundary
- "100-Meter-\\nStaffellauf"                  ← long compound alone
- "warum bin ich\\ndann so müde"              ← 2 lines, ok
- "wirklich schön"                            ← 1 line, adv+adj
- "und ich habe leider"                       ← 1 line, then "nie genug Zeit\\ndafür gehabt" follows
- "nie genug Zeit\\ndafür gehabt"             ← 2 lines, negation kept with noun phrase

Examples of BAD splits (NEVER produce these):
- "und das Wetter\\nwar extrem" + "schön"     ← BAD: splits "extrem schön"
- "ich war auch sehr" + "müde"                ← BAD: splits "sehr müde"
- "weil ich dachte\\nimmer"                   ← BAD: splits "dachte immer"
- "seit Jahren in" + "Berlin"                 ← BAD: splits "in Berlin"
- "und ich habe leider\\nnie genug" + "Zeit dafür gehabt"   ← BAD: splits "nie ... Zeit gehabt"

RULES:
- Capitalise nouns and proper names — German capitalises every noun, anywhere ("Morgen", "Ärzte", "Wassereinlagerungen", "Dosis", "Antonio Bianco").
- A noun stays a noun after a determiner or quantifier — capitalise it: "jeden Morgen", "jeden Tag", "jede Woche", "am Abend", "die Dosis", "ihre Werte" (the noun "Werte" is capital regardless of the word before it). Watch the time-of-day nouns "Morgen/Abend/Mittag/Tag/Nacht" — capital as nouns ("jeden Morgen"), lowercase ONLY as the adverb "morgens/abends" or "morgen" meaning tomorrow.
- Capitalise the formal-address words Sie, Ihr, Ihre, Ihren, Ihrem, Ihrer, Ihres, Ihnen when they mean the formal "you". Use the SURROUNDING captions as context: e.g. a doctor quoted speaking to the patient ("… der gleiche Satz: ihre Werte sind doch in Ordnung") is formal → "Ihre Werte". Keep "sie/ihr" lowercase only when they clearly mean she / they / her.
- EVERYTHING ELSE is lowercase, INCLUDING THE FIRST WORD of a caption. These are mid-sentence fragments — never capitalise a word just because it starts the line. Verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, articles, prepositions and conjunctions stay lowercase at the start ("bis", "egal", "von", "jeden", "trinkst", "gesund", "und").
- Change ONLY letter case. Do NOT add, remove, reorder, split, merge or respell any word. Do NOT change any digit, punctuation mark or spacing.

Return a JSON array of EXACTLY {last + 1} strings — caption [0] first … caption [{last}] last — each the corresponding caption with corrected capitalisation and otherwise IDENTICAL (same words, same order, same punctuation)."""
