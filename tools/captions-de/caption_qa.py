"""PROTOTYPE — Approach B: Gemini-based caption QA pass.

Compares FINISHED captions (an .srt) against the source BRIEFING (the Notion
script) and flags likely WhisperX mistranscriptions: words faithfully transcribed
from misspoken audio, garbled brand/technical terms, wrong words that slipped past
because Whisper hears exactly what was said. The briefing is the source of truth,
but it also contains NON-SPOKEN stage directions (whiteboard layouts, parenthetical
notes) — the model is told to ignore those and only judge the spoken voiceover.

Unlike the old browser SRT-checker this does NOT do a literal token diff (which
floods on stage directions and breaks on German umlauts). It asks Gemini, which
understands what is spoken vs a production note and knows domain vocabulary.

EXPERIMENTAL / DISCARDABLE: lives OUTSIDE the production pipeline (caption.py is
untouched) on its own git branch. To revert: delete this file or drop the branch.
Not wired into the app yet — run it standalone:

    ../../venv/bin/python caption_qa.py <captions.srt> <briefing.txt> [--language de]

Reuses caption.py's Gemini plumbing (.env loading, retry/backoff, JSON parsing).

The CAPTIONS below were produced by automatic speech recognition (WhisperX) of a
voiceover. ASR transcribes exactly what it HEARS, so when the speaker misspoke, or
a brand / technical / medical term was mis-heard, the wrong word silently entered
the captions. Your job: find those LIKELY MISTRANSCRIPTIONS.

The BRIEFING is the script the voiceover was based on — your source of truth for
the intended words and the correct spelling of names and terms.
{canon_line}
CRITICAL RULES:
- The briefing contains NON-SPOKEN STAGE DIRECTIONS: parenthetical notes, whiteboard
  layouts, instructions to the editor ("steht an dem Whiteboard…", "(Das Blatt
  aufdecken)", arrows, diagrams). These are NEVER spoken. IGNORE them completely —
  a word missing from the captions because it was only a stage direction is NOT an error.
- The voiceover may legitimately differ from the briefing (improvisation, reordering,
  dropped filler). Do NOT flag a paraphrase or a legitimately different-but-valid word.

Flag these kinds of issue (and ONLY these). Give each a "type":
- "spelling"  — a garbled/misspelled word, or a mangled brand/technical/medical term
                or name (compare against the briefing's correct spelling).
- "wrong-word"— a different word that sounds like the intended one (ASR soundalike),
                e.g. "Lieber" for "Leber".
- "capitalization" — a German capitalization error: a noun or proper name written
                lowercase, or a word clearly wrongly capitalized. IMPORTANT house-style
                caveat: these captions DELIBERATELY lowercase the FIRST word of a
                fragment when it is a function word (article, pronoun, preposition,
                conjunction, adverb, verb) — that is CORRECT, do NOT flag it. Only flag
                genuinely wrong German casing (a common noun or proper name that should
                be capital but isn't, anywhere in the caption). Only report it if your
                corrected casing actually DIFFERS from what is already in the caption.
- "missing"   — a word that was clearly SPOKEN (it appears in the spoken briefing text)
                but is ABSENT from the captions, AND whose omission makes the caption
                grammatically broken or changes the meaning — especially a NEGATION
                ("nicht", "kein", "ohne") or a key noun/verb. Put the word to add in
                "suggestion" and a short slice of the caption where it belongs in "suspect".
                STRICT: do NOT flag a word that only appears in a stage direction, a
                dropped filler, or anything covered by normal paraphrasing — only a
                genuine, meaning-changing omission of spoken content.
- When unsure, DO NOT flag it — favour precision over recall.
- Do NOT flag punctuation or line-break differences.
