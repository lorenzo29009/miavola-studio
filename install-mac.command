 Mariposa Studio — Installer for macOS
====================================================

This single installer sets up EVERYTHING needed to run
the app and all 4 bundled tools:

  • Homebrew (if missing)
  • Python 3.12 (only if no 3.10–3.13 is found)
  • ffmpeg               (Flow Cropper + Captions)
  • A local virtualenv in ./venv (PySide6-Essentials,
    opencv) for the app + Extract Frame
  • WhisperX in ~/whisperx (~3 GB; German Captions)
  • Your Gemini API key   (Camera Prompts + Animator
    + Captions polishing)

When it finishes, just double-click "Mariposa Studio.app".

Press Enter to continue, or Ctrl+C to cancel.
